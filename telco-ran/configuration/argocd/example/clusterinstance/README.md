# Structure

This directory contains example `ClusterInstance` CRs for installation of a Telco RAN cluster using [siteconfig operator](https://github.com/stolostron/siteconfig) and [Multi Cluster Engine (MCE)](https://github.com/stolostron/deploy/tree/master/multiclusterengine). The CRs contained here are examples and must be tuned/configured to your particular hardware and environment. However these represent the best-practices and the general pattern shown here is recommended.
